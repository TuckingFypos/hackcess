# hackcess

Hackcess is a mobile hacking simulation that challenges its users to "hack the world."
By DDoSing servers and taking over devices by answering riddles and solving problems, players build up a network of 'accessed machines'.
These machines provide the player with the network and memory resources required to hack bigger and better systems.

Players will work to discover:
What exactly is Hackcess? Who developed these hacking tools? Who provides the infrastructure?
